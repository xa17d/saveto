<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started

<!-- Prerequisites -->
### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Java 11+
- sh

### Code Checks

Before committing run:
```bash
./debugCheck.sh
```

This compiles the code, runs ktlint, unit tests and android tests.

### Package-Structure

- `at.xa1.saveto`: main package with the most fundamental classes (like `MainActivity` and `MainCoordinator`)
  - `common`: generic, non-app-specific classes
    - `android`: generic, non-app-specific classes that are strongly related to Android.
  - `di`: Dependency Injection.
  - `feature`: sub packages contain pieces of functionality, that don't depend on other features.
  - `ui`: User interface components that are not feature specific.


## Release

_This is only relevant for the deployer._

1. Update `versionCode` and `versionName` in `versions.gradle`
2. Run:
   ```bash
   ./release.sh
   ```
3. Upload `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` to Google Play Console.

### Signing

Signing is located in `.signing` folder.
It is added to `.gitignore` to avoid accidental committing.
Extract `release.jks` (and `private_key.pepk`) from Password Manager to `.signing`.

Create `.signing/keystore.properties`:
```properties
keyAlias=releaseKey
keyPassword=[PASSWORD FROM PASSWORD MANAGER]
storeFile=.signing/release.jks
storePassword=[SAME PASSWORD FROM PASSWORD MANAGER]
```

### Create Screenshots

* Start Emulator.
* Make sure status bar is empty.
* Make sure battery, network and wifi are full (emulator settings).
* Use gesture navigation to hide navigation buttons (android settings).
* Set time to: 04:01  (android settings).
* Use tests in `PlayStoreScreenshots` for individual screens:
  * Clear screenshot folder on emulator:
    ```sh
    adb shell rm -rf "/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/screenshots"
    ```
  * Run [`PlayStoreScreenshots` tests](app/src/androidTest/java/at/xa1/saveto/screenshot/PlayStoreScreenshots.kt)
  * Download screenshots from emulator:
    ```sh
    adb pull "/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/screenshots"
    ```
